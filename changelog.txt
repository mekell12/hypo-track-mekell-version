    + Added a dropdown to select a track
v20250701a: (2025-07-01):
    * Renamed accessible colors to alternative colors
    * Changed colors for categories 7 through 9 in the alternative color scheme
v20250630c: (2025-06-30):
    + Hovering the mouse over a track tells you which track # you're hovering over
    * Changed the category 6 point color for accessible colors mode because it looked too similar to the depression color
    - Removed plans for a storm naming/tracking menu that were within the code
v20250630b: (2025-06-30):
    + Best track mode (rounds points to the nearest tenth of a degree, similarly to positions in best track databases)
v20250630a: (2025-06-30):
    + After forking this project, added unofficial hurricane categories 6 through 10
