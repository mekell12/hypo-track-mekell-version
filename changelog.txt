About: Fan-made updates to a browser-based tool for creating hypothetical tropical cyclone tracks

v20250630c: (2025-06-30):
    + Hovering the mouse over a track tells you which track # you're hovering over
    * Changed the category 6 point color for accessible colors mode because it looked too similar to the depression color
    - Removed plans for a storm naming/tracking menu that were within the code
v20250630b: (2025-06-30):
    + Best track mode (rounds points to the nearest tenth of a degree, similarly to positions in best track databases)
v20250630a: (2025-06-30):
    + After forking this project, added unofficial hurricane categories 6 through 10
    + Stroke weight is now thinner in small point mode
